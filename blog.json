		"content": "&lt;p&gt;Since its inception in 2000, cloud computing has revolutionized data management for individuals and companies. In recent years, companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have become the core for data hosting worldwide. Along with the creation of many employment opportunities for data analysts and IT experts worldwide, cloud computing jas helped countless companies manage and secure their data. Cloud computing has offered better flexibility and Scalability, which was initially an expensive and time-consuming task by automating processes that individual companies initially did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though cloud computing is at an all-time high, valued at 371.4 billion dollars, it still has room for expansion. In contrast to most people’s thinking, cloud computing is a compilation of various entities. These techniques could help better implement the concept of cloud computing into our daily lives if taken into serious consideration. By researching privacy-preserving models and information-centric security, IT technicians hope to improve the safety of the data we store in the cloud. We will be taking a look at some of the research topics that encompass cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Programs run by big companies tend to produce enormous amounts of data in a short period. This data is called big data. This data is usually too much to store in in-house servers that require constant maintenance and updates. Cloud computing allows companies to keep their big data without buying additional physical storage devices and hiring personnel to install and maintain them while also saving time in the process. Big data is categorized into Structured and unstructured data. Structured information is stored in a specific format or order, while unstructured data is stored as uploaded without being arranged. Data is organized in three ways: Variety, Volume, and Velocity. Variety is simply the format in which data is stored; it could be images, text, audio, and many more. Volume is the quantity of data a particular service provider holds. Velocity refers to the speed at which data is generated and transmitted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data provides invaluable insights into customer preferences and information for companies to help them give better services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud deployment models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cloud deployment models are the various techniques that service providers use to allocate access to the cloud. You can think of them as packages. The primary deployment models in cloud computing are Public, Private, Hybrid, and Community cloud. The location of the infrastructure is what determines the deployment method used. For instance, Public deployment services offer access to users that any organization does not register; the general public .But access is controlled by a third party. Private deployment models are used by organizations that want to keep data accessible only by authorized parties. Hybrid models involve private and public models and the public portion gives access to non-critical data. In contrast, the private part only offers access to the more critical data bit to authorized people. On the other hand, provides access to the community model for all users who subscribe to cloud services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firewalls, virtual private networks, and tokenization enhance data security. Security is one of the biggest concerns in cloud computing. Most companies are still skeptical about leaving the safety of their sensitive data to outside parties. There are three distinct subfields of data security research: trustworthy computing, information-centric security, and privacy-preserving models. Apart from that, taking precautions to safeguard Accessibility, Integrity, and Confidentiality brings data closer to being secure. As more organizations opt for cloud hosting, it is quite comforting for them to be sure that their information is protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile cloud computing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mobile cloud computing has to be one of the best innovations of cloud computing. It offers longer battery life and immense flexibility, but it is also cheaper since mobile phones are cheaper to acquire compared to personal computers. With a phone as an access point, users can log into the cloud quickly and carry out processes at will and from anywhere on the planet with a good internet connection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevOps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DevOps is designed to do away with the barrier between Development and Operations, the combined terms to form DevOps. Cloud computing eliminates the need for sophisticated software by integrating various tools and technologies used to build, test, and distribute applications quickly. As an added advantage, these tools can be tailor-made to fit the specifications required by a particular organization or individual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge Computing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This practice involves processing data close to the source rather than in data warehouses. This practice eradicates the premise of delayed response since the node nearest to the source holds the data. It also increases the security of data without compromising efficiency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containerization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Containerization is the ability of the cloud to host an operating system on a virtual host space.Co allows the user to remotely run a program and access its corresponding resources to increase developer productivity. Containerization offers all virtual machine features but at a lower price since cloud computing is in a stable environment. This aspect of cloud computing has allowed flexibility at its peak; even when the hardware cannot perform specific tasks, users can still deliver on their work.&lt;/p&gt;"

		"category": "Cloud computing",
		"content": "&lt;p&gt;Cloud technology is penetrating deep into every industry because of its ability to offer seamless services over the network.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, healthcare is one of the rapid adopters of cloud computing technology.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the surveys show, the global healthcare cloud market is expected to grow to USD 35.6 billion by 2022, at an annual CAGR of 11.6 percent.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, 83 percent of the healthcare industry is already using cloud technology.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;whats-driving-cloud-in-healthcare&quot; href=&quot;#whats-driving-cloud-in-healthcare&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; What's Driving 'Cloud' in Healthcare? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for driving cloud demand in the healthcare industry.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the key reasons include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; • &lt;strong&gt;Data Access&lt;/strong&gt;: Accessing the right data from large volumes has been a tough task for healthcare. Cloud made that easier by streamlining the data access, thus making it easy to track patient records.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Storage and Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Data storage is not that easy and inefficient management can cause a break in the process. Cloud helps you in this, cutting down your costs required for management by means of additional staff.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Data Backup&lt;/strong&gt;: With effective backup and recovery options, the cloud ensures no data is lost and promises required data safety.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Smart Data Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;: Cloud provides scope for effective utilization of smart data solutions like Big Data, thus helping in identification, prediction, and make informed decision-making.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud creates perfect sync between the data and devices in the form of wearable devices, IoT-enabled devices, facilitating data interoperability.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Effective and informed decision-making&lt;/strong&gt;: This is another key advantage with cloud usage that helps healthcare pros to make informed decisions using the easily accessible and transferable data on the cloud.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Research-backed solutions&lt;/strong&gt;: Cloud enables medical pros to take research-backed solutions, thus helping them make accurate decisions that are extensive in nature if required.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Telehealth Services&lt;/strong&gt;: Online health consulting and remote healthcare support are the most happening trends, globally. Cloud stands at the core for telehealth services.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many such advantages that the cloud offers to the healthcare sector.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud on Demand, Security A Concern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Let&#39;s take a look at the overall healthcare cloud market, by demand and security challenge:  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • The global cloud healthcare market is expected to register at a CAGR of 2 percent towards 2022&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • The North American healthcare cloud market is poised to be a USD 51.4 billion market by 2024&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • The average cost of an average health record is USD 50&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • An average healthcare provider upload nearly 8 TB per month onto the cloud  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Security Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • 93 percent of the cloud services in the healthcare sector is at medium-high risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • More than 90 million health records were exposed in the last 12 months&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • Only 7 percent of cloud services in use are meeting compliance and security norms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • Only 4 percent of healthcare services using cloud support multi-factor authentication  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is evident in the above facts that cloud computing is also posing a challenge to the healthcare sector in the name of security.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;factors-that-are-serious-concerns-for-the-healthcare-industry-in-using-cloud-computing-are&quot; href=&quot;#factors-that-are-serious-concerns-for-the-healthcare-industry-in-using-cloud-computing-are&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Factors that are serious concerns for the healthcare industry in using cloud computing are: &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Data Loss&lt;/strong&gt;: Data sensitivity is of topmost concern for most companies. While there exist solutions like blockchain, IAM, and others to secure the critical patient data and other electronic health records, cyber threats are fast emerging posing a continuous threat to data loss.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Compliance and Regulatory&lt;/strong&gt;: Given the above figure, it&#39;s evident that only a very less percentage of healthcare services using cloud are meeting the compliance norms like HIPPA, GDPR, among others.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Disasters and Downtimes&lt;/strong&gt;: Despite many measures, unexpected downtimes and disasters continue to be the haunting factors for data security and data safety. However, having a disaster recovery or a business continuity plan can limit the severity of the loss.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the records show, many such factors have caused considerable losses to the healthcare industry, US and globally, exposing lakhs of patient records and other crucial health information.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Security concerns around cloud are on the rise, on par with the demand for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veritis.com/blog/cloud-computing-in-healthcare-looking-for-security-advantage/&quot;&gt;cloud adoption in the healthcare sector&lt;/a&gt;. Despite many emerging solutions, healthcare companies are still worried about the security of patient data and other confidential records.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, finding a solution to these security risks makes cloud computing in healthcare a successful story. And, you would need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veritis.com/solutions/cloud/&quot;&gt;strategic cloud consulting partner&lt;/a&gt; to do so!

		"title": "Big Data Vs. Market Research",
		"banner": "",
		"category": "Big Data",
		"content": "&lt;p&gt;Big data is a phrase that has been flying around for a little while now. It has become a topical conversation point within the world of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleversoftwaregroup.com/services&quot;&gt;custom software development&lt;/a&gt; and technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data and data collection has become second nature on many e-commerce platforms and websites. It is an easy way to collect a mass amount of information about consumers, in a relatively short space of time. Big data allows individuals’ preferences and ideals to be gathered in one foul swoop, without diving very deep beneath the surface.   However, it seems that big data has started to venture into the territory of traditional market research. In time, it is thought that big data could eradicate old school market research altogether. Why would you need to carry out extensive surveys and questionnaires, when data can be collected online with far much more ease?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite this shift, there are key differences between the way big data and market research methods should be used. Although big data is affecting the way market research is conducted and put into practice, both are very valuable tools in their own right and should be used accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Old Vs New&lt;br&gt; The amount of data available to be collected from consumers is mind boggling. As technology and bespoke software development becomes more innovative and complex, so will the data that is accumulated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typically, big data is amassed regarding our online behaviours. Advanced software and technology systems are then used to decide what these interactions correlate to. In turn, this affects our preferences and personalizes our online experiences. This is why an advert might appear on the side of a website or social media platform, of a product you have just been looking at online. Or perhaps you have just been discussing what to have for dinner and your phone casually displays an ad for a food delivery app. This may seem like a very daunting prospect, but in the long run, data collection will greatly enhance our user experience and journey when interacting with digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More traditional market research studies revolve around cumulating specific amounts of knowledge, using multiple methods or large sample sizes. A great depth of information can be collected in this way and it has worked perfectly well for many years. However, there is now a new kid on the block and the information collected doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of that that big data can muster. This is why many brands and companies now choose big data methods to learn nitty, gritty details about their consumers, opposed to conventional market research techniques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human-Centred Approach&lt;br&gt; Although a wealth of information can be gathered through big data, specialist custom software techniques are often required to sift through it and unravel the information provided. This can often lead to specific details being missed and subsequently losing the human element of data collection. This is something that well established market research methods are better suited to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can often be forgotten that humans are the end users and target audience in many circumstances; this is something big data is far from understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite being more human-centred, market research struggles to represent the entirety of a specific market. This is why big data is predominately affecting the use of market research, as it is better at displaying and understanding market niches more clearly. Good response rates and sample sizes are required from market research studies, to accumulate enough usable information and to provide a voice of the customer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which Should be Used for What?&lt;br&gt; Ultimately, big data is used in aim to predict consumer behaviours and trends, so digital services can be tailored to create a more effective, personalized experience whilst online. Yes, big data is affecting the application of market research, but sometimes an old dog can learn new tricks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deciding whether to apply big data or market research to a situation will depend on the desired end results. What do you wish to learn from consumer behaviour?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data can provide much deeper insights into business trends. More specifically, tracking purchasing and browsing behaviours in real time, allowing mass collection of data in a small timeframe. This will lead to more effective decisions to be made, regarding digital platform features and predicting future behaviours. Think of it as a virtual crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, traditional market research is a much more personable method of collecting information, with the consumer often at the heart of studies. It will delve into why an individual will make a specific decision, according to their emotional preference. In theory, market research will predict future trends made on opinions and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a simple roundup:&lt;br&gt; Big Data = Behaviour&lt;br&gt; Market Research = Intention&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To Wrap Up&lt;br&gt; So, there we have it. Big data will more than likely replace traditional market research methods, but the human-focused element needs to be enhanced before this happens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data is already well established and engrained within social media and analytics collected via the digital platforms we use. Personal data has become readily accessible in today’s digital society, meaning the way we consume product information and media can be easily recorded virtually, without us even noticing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data will change the core of physical market research in the long term, as the world continues to transform into an increasingly digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;"

Why does this bug exist?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don’t find a bug;&lt;/strong&gt; Why didn’t I find this bug? What am I doing wrong?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to know why you couldn’t find that bug. Maybe you were able to find that bug in your practice on the VM but you are not able to find the bug in the actual website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to know Why&lt;/strong&gt;. Possibly the website you are testing has implemented a good security mechanism. So you have to learn what they doing right. Once you know more about doing things right, you will automatically know how to do things wrong. And next time when you go to test another website you will know what these guys are missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The common problem in bug bounty hunters is that once you find a bug, you get over excited. You want to get paid for it quickly, your focus redirects to money and you stop logical thinking at $200 bounty. And as a result, sometimes your bug will have much more impact. Only if you think more and questions, you can make it to $2000 or even $20000 bounty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, as a web security researcher, you take regular everyday things and think of malicious ways of using those things. So, asking questions will keep you from looking at the website from a bird’s eye view and find low hanging fruit i.e, security vulnerabilities without any serious impact. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You need to know everything that&#39;s happening in the web development world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to be an above average web security researcher, you have to take a closer and deeper look at how the different technologies used by the website come together. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Asking questions will help you do so&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This post was originally published &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinxloud.com/why-questioning-is-pivotal-to-successful-career-in-web-security/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

		"title": "Types of Security Assessments and Which One is Right for Your Organization",
		"banner": "",
		"category": "Security",
		"content": "&lt;p&gt;So you’re worried about your organization’s current security posture. You see the news stories about the latest data breach, or the newest ransomware attack, and you wonder if you’re doing enough to keep your data safe. With cyber attacks on the rise, every organization, no matter how large or small, needs to understand the fundamentals of information security, and take the steps necessary to improve their defenses. Part of this is testing your security controls. But what type of tests do you need and when?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, I’d like to talk about three different types of security assessments: “security audits”, “vulnerability assessments”, and “penetration tests”. Although these terms are often used interchangeably, they are, in fact, very different types of tests. One is not a replacement for the others, and you should consider implementing a testing strategy that includes all three.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;security-audits&quot; href=&quot;#security-audits&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Security Audits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A security audit is an evaluation of an organization’s security controls against an established set of standards. There is generally a focus on policies and procedures, and ensuring that these are implemented properly. This can include things like ensuring that user access is based on the principle of least privilege, network firewalls are in place and correctly configured, and that operating systems and software applications are updated to the latest patch versions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The purpose of a security audit can vary from organization to organization. Businesses in certain industries may be required to conduct regular audits in order to maintain compliance with regulations such as HIPAA or PCI. Some businesses may conduct audits to gain widely recognized industry certifications, like the ISO/IEC 27001. These types of certifications help to reassure customers and partners that industry best practices are being followed. Still other businesses may simply be performing an audit to evaluate their current security posture and identify areas where improvements can be made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your organization is just getting started with your information security program, an audit is a great place to start. Identifying your assets and the risks that you face, and ensuring that you have appropriate policies and procedures in place, are important first steps in improving your security posture. In this case an internal audit would be appropriate. Internal audits are conducted by your own security team, and are much less expensive than hiring an outside consultant to conduct the audit for you. This means they can be conducted more frequently. If you’re seeking certification, or if it’s required for your industry, you’ll need to bring in a third-party to conduct your audit. While more expensive than an internal audit, an experienced security professional with a fresh set of eyes may find items that were overlooked by your internal team. Regardless of which type of audit you use, they should be conducted on a regular basis. Ideally, you’ll set up a schedule that includes a combination of both internal and third-party audits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While security audits are valuable for ensuring that a base set of standards are being met, they shouldn’t be considered a “complete” evaluation of an organization’s security. An audit doesn’t generally evaluate the effectiveness of the security controls on the system’s components. Even when components are configured correctly, there is still the possibility that an attacker can find a vulnerability and gain access. This is where the other types of assessments can help to fill in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;vulnerability-assessments&quot; href=&quot;#vulnerability-assessments&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Vulnerability Assessments &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A vulnerability assessment is an assessment of your system’s devices, operating systems and software applications to identify vulnerabilities. This could include out-of-date software, devices with firmware that contains known vulnerabilities, etc. Vulnerability assessments are often conducted using automated scanning tools. Once completed, the vulnerability assessment report will include recommendations for updating devices or patching software.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New vulnerabilities in software are being found continuously, and it’s important to ensure that your systems are kept up-to-date. The low cost and ease of automation allow vulnerability assessments to be conducted on a regular basis. They can even be included as part of your deployment pipelines. If your organization has the resources, it may be beneficial to task members of your security team as security researchers. Security researchers seek out new vulnerabilities that may be missed by automated tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While this type of assessment is great for identifying necessary updates, it stops short of actually attempting to exploit the vulnerabilities that are found. For this you’ll need to conduct penetration testing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;penetration-tests&quot; href=&quot;#penetration-tests&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Penetration Tests &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A penetration test simulates a real-world attack. Testers will attempt to identify and exploit any vulnerabilities within your system. This type of test may use combinations of known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weak detection or prevention mechanisms to identify risks that were missed by both security audits and vulnerability assessments. This type of test also allows you to evaluate your monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scope of a penetration test can vary widely, depending on what parts of your system you intend to evaluate. During the planning phase, you’ll need to identify which assets are in-scope, the duration of the test, how any data obtained during the test will be handled, and how much information the testers will be given prior to the engagement. When determining these items, you’ll have to consider both the cost (the broader the scope, the longer the test, and the higher the cost) and the impact on your business (testing production resources may have a negative impact).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several different types of penetration tests, based on the information the testers are given prior to the test. In a black-box test, the testers are not provided with any information about the system. They will need to conduct recon to identify potential targets. This type of test is the closest thing to a real-world attack, and it’s a good way to test your intrusion detection systems. A gray-box test starts with the testers being given limited information. This may include IP addresses of target machines, operating systems and installed applications, and possibly even user credentials. The main benefit of a gray-box test is that it speeds up the testing process. Testers are able to start attacking the target immediately, without the need to conduct recon first. Providing user credentials allows the testers to evaluate the system from the inside, which could help them to find privilege escalation vulnerabilities, or additional connected targets. Finally, in a white-box test, the testers are given full access to the target. For application tests, this may mean the testers can view the source code to help them identify potential vulnerabilities. For network tests, the testers may be given a network diagram to help them understand how the various components are connected. The main benefit here is that the testers have a more complete view of the system going into the engagement, and can conduct a more thorough test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whichever type of penetration test you use, the findings can help identify areas where additional resources should be focused. One important thing to note is that a penetration test shouldn’t be conducted until both the security audit and vulnerability assessments have been completed, and any improvements implemented. If you don’t believe that you’ve already done everything you can to secure your system, then a penetration test will just be a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hopefully this has given you a better understanding of these three types of security assessments, and the purposes of each. Remember, these tests are not interchangeable. Each has its purpose, and they should all be used in conjunction with one another. Ideally, you will conduct all three on a regular basis. Doing so will help to set your organization up for success and prevent you from becoming the next data breach headline.&lt;br&gt;"

AI is a sub-area of AI, that centers around preparing a PC or machine from a particular arrangement of datasets, that at that point prepares the model to play out the errands appointed to them effectively and figure out how to improve them en route. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The connection between them could be the subjects engaged with it, Operations Research should be possible just with insights, then again, AI, and Machine Learning both require Probability and Statistics.

Basically adding JS to make sites interactive. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Web3 is to be where everything above can communicate With a blockchain to retrieve metadata or data.

Decentralization of metadata and web service are really hard and expensive to set up. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;My point is that You Must &lt;strong&gt;DYOR&lt;/strong&gt; whenever someone tell you to invest or buy something. &lt;br&gt; Web3 is not one thing but a combination of many technology interconnected. &lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;!!!Warning not a Web3 or crypto expert just giving out my perspective on the situation.!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a Scammers Paradise ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;This one is a controversial topic as there could be some value and use case for a project, it does not mean that the intention of some is to make money and Rug Pull some folks as they say these days.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;So Lil Jonny has an idea, he made a project called &lt;strong&gt;&quot;You&#39;re getting Scammed&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; as a Social experiment. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Everywhere you look, this project is told to be a scam and social experiment by the creator himself. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The project is live now and one huge influencer Lil Pi decided to tweet  &quot;my fam just got the &lt;strong&gt;&quot;You&#39;re getting Scammed&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;  Token do not buy not financial advice &quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It started trending that he invested in that project and the Degenerates&#39; army jump in first trying to buy and sell to others to make profits,  but they cants sell.

		"category": "Blockchain",
		"content": "&lt;p&gt;The digital currency craze is leading to a slew of new media companies that aim to win market share as interest in cryptocurrencies grows. According to a recent report by U.S. crypto exchange Gemini, 14% of the population owns cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum. The report further found that 13% of respondents intend to purchase digital assets in the next year. Online searches for information about crypto are also on the rise. This is creating an opportunity for media companies to generate more ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risk these media companies faced for a long time was that the crypto market could dissolve at any time. But with the growth in ownership of cryptocurrencies, that doesn’t seem likely to happen soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, crypto media firms have to contend with running a new business in an events industry largely depleted by the pandemic. While virtual events still exist, the revenue from ticket sales and sponsorships is not nearly as significant, industry observers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crypto media companies also have to compete with social media platforms that have consumed most of the ad revenue that used to flow to news companies. Ben Schiller, a managing editor at CoinDesk, told Fortune that crypto media firms have to compete with these platforms not only for money but for clout and attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like in the mainstream tech industry, many of the influential crypto leaders typically turn to platforms like Twitter and Medium to get their message out, rather than use media outlets as intermediaries, Schiller said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing they don’t have to worry about in the short term is market growth. The market valuation for cryptocurrency is projected to cross $1.8 billion by 2027, according to Global Market Insights. The growing demand for digital assets and secure transactions is expected to contribute significantly to market growth, the firm said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;about-coinparative&quot; href=&quot;#about-coinparative&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; About Coinparative &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;**&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinparative.com/&quot;&gt;Coinparative&lt;/a&gt; is a digital news and research media outlet focused on cryptocurrencies, digital assets and blockchain.

		"content": "&lt;p&gt;Hey all! Last month we had an interesting and enlightening call with Shadab, who is presently a Full-stack developer working in React, who previously has worked for 2 years in the R&amp;amp;D department of a Multi-National Corp as a Blockchain Research Analyst. The crux of this discussion was Shadab&#39;s opinion that beginners shouldn&#39;t focus on blockchain while starting to learn programming. Here&#39;s a short summary of the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;shadabs-story&quot; href=&quot;#shadabs-story&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Shadab&#39;s Story &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shadab has completed his bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. During senior year of college, he realized that a job in the Mechanical sector wasn&#39;t something that he would pursue long term, and was introduced to the world of tech through an internship that he did at a startup. Through a growing interest in cryptocurrencies and tech, Shadab started mining cryptocurrencies himself, and eventually built projects around it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He eventually started working in the R&amp;amp;D department of TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) as a Blockchain Researcher, where he made use of Hyperledger Fabric and the Ethereum Network to build Proof of Concept projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;what-is-smart-contract-development&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-smart-contract-development&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; What is Smart Contract Development? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several layers in any software. A frontend layer, which may use HTML, CSS and JS to build and display a UI, and a backend layer involving a server for processing transactions and a database for persisting data. Smart Contracts are just an addition to these layers. For a complete app, all layers have to be involved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smart Contracts, unlike other software layers, are very flexible. They may not need a separate frontend and backend. Business logic can be coded in the smart contracts and deployed into the respective network directly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Smart Contracts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smart contracts have an inbuilt system of authentication. You supply your public key, and sign a secret with your private key, to prove your identity. Smart Contracts run on blockchain nodes, meaning any machine which is part of the blockchain can execute your code. You pay the nodes a gas fee to have your code executed.  To store data on the blockchain, you similarly pay gas fees to have your data/variables appended to the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;why-not-learn-it-as-a-beginner&quot; href=&quot;#why-not-learn-it-as-a-beginner&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Why not Learn it as a Beginner? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Shadab gained a lot of expertise in the field of blockchain, he advices young developers to skip the trend. In TCS, Shadab worked with clients from the automotive industry who wanted to integrate Blockchain with manufacturing. In this process, he realized that the value proposition of blockchain technologies was low, because of the low value generation as compared to the investment needed to run and maintain a smart contract.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His observation was that the interest in these technologies has been because of the hype itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Owing to this hype, students and new-comers to technology are not yet accustomed with the underlying technologies themselves. Web3 App development is similar to other software development. UI and UX still matters. Building projects by the traditional ways is how one truly understands the true meaning and use of decentralized systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shadab also stresses on the fact that Blockchain is still in a very adolescent stage, where it&#39;s not mature enough to handle the complexities of real world problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can check the complete conversation on YouTube.
