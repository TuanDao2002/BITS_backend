		"content": "&lt;p&gt;Since its inception in 2000, cloud computing has revolutionized data management for individuals and companies. In recent years, companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have become the core for data hosting worldwide. Along with the creation of many employment opportunities for data analysts and IT experts worldwide, cloud computing jas helped countless companies manage and secure their data. Cloud computing has offered better flexibility and Scalability, which was initially an expensive and time-consuming task by automating processes that individual companies initially did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though cloud computing is at an all-time high, valued at 371.4 billion dollars, it still has room for expansion. In contrast to most people’s thinking, cloud computing is a compilation of various entities. These techniques could help better implement the concept of cloud computing into our daily lives if taken into serious consideration. By researching privacy-preserving models and information-centric security, IT technicians hope to improve the safety of the data we store in the cloud. We will be taking a look at some of the research topics that encompass cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Programs run by big companies tend to produce enormous amounts of data in a short period. This data is called big data. This data is usually too much to store in in-house servers that require constant maintenance and updates. Cloud computing allows companies to keep their big data without buying additional physical storage devices and hiring personnel to install and maintain them while also saving time in the process. Big data is categorized into Structured and unstructured data. Structured information is stored in a specific format or order, while unstructured data is stored as uploaded without being arranged. Data is organized in three ways: Variety, Volume, and Velocity. Variety is simply the format in which data is stored; it could be images, text, audio, and many more. Volume is the quantity of data a particular service provider holds. Velocity refers to the speed at which data is generated and transmitted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data provides invaluable insights into customer preferences and information for companies to help them give better services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud deployment models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cloud deployment models are the various techniques that service providers use to allocate access to the cloud. You can think of them as packages. The primary deployment models in cloud computing are Public, Private, Hybrid, and Community cloud. The location of the infrastructure is what determines the deployment method used. For instance, Public deployment services offer access to users that any organization does not register; the general public .But access is controlled by a third party. Private deployment models are used by organizations that want to keep data accessible only by authorized parties. Hybrid models involve private and public models and the public portion gives access to non-critical data. In contrast, the private part only offers access to the more critical data bit to authorized people. On the other hand, provides access to the community model for all users who subscribe to cloud services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firewalls, virtual private networks, and tokenization enhance data security. Security is one of the biggest concerns in cloud computing. Most companies are still skeptical about leaving the safety of their sensitive data to outside parties. There are three distinct subfields of data security research: trustworthy computing, information-centric security, and privacy-preserving models. Apart from that, taking precautions to safeguard Accessibility, Integrity, and Confidentiality brings data closer to being secure. As more organizations opt for cloud hosting, it is quite comforting for them to be sure that their information is protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile cloud computing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mobile cloud computing has to be one of the best innovations of cloud computing. It offers longer battery life and immense flexibility, but it is also cheaper since mobile phones are cheaper to acquire compared to personal computers. With a phone as an access point, users can log into the cloud quickly and carry out processes at will and from anywhere on the planet with a good internet connection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevOps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DevOps is designed to do away with the barrier between Development and Operations, the combined terms to form DevOps. Cloud computing eliminates the need for sophisticated software by integrating various tools and technologies used to build, test, and distribute applications quickly. As an added advantage, these tools can be tailor-made to fit the specifications required by a particular organization or individual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge Computing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This practice involves processing data close to the source rather than in data warehouses. This practice eradicates the premise of delayed response since the node nearest to the source holds the data. It also increases the security of data without compromising efficiency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containerization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Containerization is the ability of the cloud to host an operating system on a virtual host space.Co allows the user to remotely run a program and access its corresponding resources to increase developer productivity. Containerization offers all virtual machine features but at a lower price since cloud computing is in a stable environment. This aspect of cloud computing has allowed flexibility at its peak; even when the hardware cannot perform specific tasks, users can still deliver on their work.&lt;/p&gt;"

		"category": "Cloud computing",
		"content": "&lt;p&gt;Cloud technology is penetrating deep into every industry because of its ability to offer seamless services over the network.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, healthcare is one of the rapid adopters of cloud computing technology.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the surveys show, the global healthcare cloud market is expected to grow to USD 35.6 billion by 2022, at an annual CAGR of 11.6 percent.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, 83 percent of the healthcare industry is already using cloud technology.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;whats-driving-cloud-in-healthcare&quot; href=&quot;#whats-driving-cloud-in-healthcare&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; What's Driving 'Cloud' in Healthcare? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for driving cloud demand in the healthcare industry.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the key reasons include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; • &lt;strong&gt;Data Access&lt;/strong&gt;: Accessing the right data from large volumes has been a tough task for healthcare. Cloud made that easier by streamlining the data access, thus making it easy to track patient records.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Storage and Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Data storage is not that easy and inefficient management can cause a break in the process. Cloud helps you in this, cutting down your costs required for management by means of additional staff.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Data Backup&lt;/strong&gt;: With effective backup and recovery options, the cloud ensures no data is lost and promises required data safety.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Smart Data Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;: Cloud provides scope for effective utilization of smart data solutions like Big Data, thus helping in identification, prediction, and make informed decision-making.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud creates perfect sync between the data and devices in the form of wearable devices, IoT-enabled devices, facilitating data interoperability.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Effective and informed decision-making&lt;/strong&gt;: This is another key advantage with cloud usage that helps healthcare pros to make informed decisions using the easily accessible and transferable data on the cloud.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Research-backed solutions&lt;/strong&gt;: Cloud enables medical pros to take research-backed solutions, thus helping them make accurate decisions that are extensive in nature if required.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Telehealth Services&lt;/strong&gt;: Online health consulting and remote healthcare support are the most happening trends, globally. Cloud stands at the core for telehealth services.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many such advantages that the cloud offers to the healthcare sector.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud on Demand, Security A Concern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Let&#39;s take a look at the overall healthcare cloud market, by demand and security challenge:  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • The global cloud healthcare market is expected to register at a CAGR of 2 percent towards 2022&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • The North American healthcare cloud market is poised to be a USD 51.4 billion market by 2024&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • The average cost of an average health record is USD 50&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • An average healthcare provider upload nearly 8 TB per month onto the cloud  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Security Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • 93 percent of the cloud services in the healthcare sector is at medium-high risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • More than 90 million health records were exposed in the last 12 months&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • Only 7 percent of cloud services in use are meeting compliance and security norms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; • Only 4 percent of healthcare services using cloud support multi-factor authentication  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is evident in the above facts that cloud computing is also posing a challenge to the healthcare sector in the name of security.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;factors-that-are-serious-concerns-for-the-healthcare-industry-in-using-cloud-computing-are&quot; href=&quot;#factors-that-are-serious-concerns-for-the-healthcare-industry-in-using-cloud-computing-are&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Factors that are serious concerns for the healthcare industry in using cloud computing are: &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Data Loss&lt;/strong&gt;: Data sensitivity is of topmost concern for most companies. While there exist solutions like blockchain, IAM, and others to secure the critical patient data and other electronic health records, cyber threats are fast emerging posing a continuous threat to data loss.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Compliance and Regulatory&lt;/strong&gt;: Given the above figure, it&#39;s evident that only a very less percentage of healthcare services using cloud are meeting the compliance norms like HIPPA, GDPR, among others.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Disasters and Downtimes&lt;/strong&gt;: Despite many measures, unexpected downtimes and disasters continue to be the haunting factors for data security and data safety. However, having a disaster recovery or a business continuity plan can limit the severity of the loss.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the records show, many such factors have caused considerable losses to the healthcare industry, US and globally, exposing lakhs of patient records and other crucial health information.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Security concerns around cloud are on the rise, on par with the demand for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veritis.com/blog/cloud-computing-in-healthcare-looking-for-security-advantage/&quot;&gt;cloud adoption in the healthcare sector&lt;/a&gt;. Despite many emerging solutions, healthcare companies are still worried about the security of patient data and other confidential records.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, finding a solution to these security risks makes cloud computing in healthcare a successful story. And, you would need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veritis.com/solutions/cloud/&quot;&gt;strategic cloud consulting partner&lt;/a&gt; to do so!

		"title": "Big Data Vs. Market Research",
		"banner": "",
		"category": "Big Data",
		"content": "&lt;p&gt;Big data is a phrase that has been flying around for a little while now. It has become a topical conversation point within the world of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleversoftwaregroup.com/services&quot;&gt;custom software development&lt;/a&gt; and technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data and data collection has become second nature on many e-commerce platforms and websites. It is an easy way to collect a mass amount of information about consumers, in a relatively short space of time. Big data allows individuals’ preferences and ideals to be gathered in one foul swoop, without diving very deep beneath the surface.   However, it seems that big data has started to venture into the territory of traditional market research. In time, it is thought that big data could eradicate old school market research altogether. Why would you need to carry out extensive surveys and questionnaires, when data can be collected online with far much more ease?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite this shift, there are key differences between the way big data and market research methods should be used. Although big data is affecting the way market research is conducted and put into practice, both are very valuable tools in their own right and should be used accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Old Vs New&lt;br&gt; The amount of data available to be collected from consumers is mind boggling. As technology and bespoke software development becomes more innovative and complex, so will the data that is accumulated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typically, big data is amassed regarding our online behaviours. Advanced software and technology systems are then used to decide what these interactions correlate to. In turn, this affects our preferences and personalizes our online experiences. This is why an advert might appear on the side of a website or social media platform, of a product you have just been looking at online. Or perhaps you have just been discussing what to have for dinner and your phone casually displays an ad for a food delivery app. This may seem like a very daunting prospect, but in the long run, data collection will greatly enhance our user experience and journey when interacting with digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More traditional market research studies revolve around cumulating specific amounts of knowledge, using multiple methods or large sample sizes. A great depth of information can be collected in this way and it has worked perfectly well for many years. However, there is now a new kid on the block and the information collected doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of that that big data can muster. This is why many brands and companies now choose big data methods to learn nitty, gritty details about their consumers, opposed to conventional market research techniques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human-Centred Approach&lt;br&gt; Although a wealth of information can be gathered through big data, specialist custom software techniques are often required to sift through it and unravel the information provided. This can often lead to specific details being missed and subsequently losing the human element of data collection. This is something that well established market research methods are better suited to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can often be forgotten that humans are the end users and target audience in many circumstances; this is something big data is far from understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite being more human-centred, market research struggles to represent the entirety of a specific market. This is why big data is predominately affecting the use of market research, as it is better at displaying and understanding market niches more clearly. Good response rates and sample sizes are required from market research studies, to accumulate enough usable information and to provide a voice of the customer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which Should be Used for What?&lt;br&gt; Ultimately, big data is used in aim to predict consumer behaviours and trends, so digital services can be tailored to create a more effective, personalized experience whilst online. Yes, big data is affecting the application of market research, but sometimes an old dog can learn new tricks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deciding whether to apply big data or market research to a situation will depend on the desired end results. What do you wish to learn from consumer behaviour?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data can provide much deeper insights into business trends. More specifically, tracking purchasing and browsing behaviours in real time, allowing mass collection of data in a small timeframe. This will lead to more effective decisions to be made, regarding digital platform features and predicting future behaviours. Think of it as a virtual crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, traditional market research is a much more personable method of collecting information, with the consumer often at the heart of studies. It will delve into why an individual will make a specific decision, according to their emotional preference. In theory, market research will predict future trends made on opinions and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a simple roundup:&lt;br&gt; Big Data = Behaviour&lt;br&gt; Market Research = Intention&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To Wrap Up&lt;br&gt; So, there we have it. Big data will more than likely replace traditional market research methods, but the human-focused element needs to be enhanced before this happens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data is already well established and engrained within social media and analytics collected via the digital platforms we use. Personal data has become readily accessible in today’s digital society, meaning the way we consume product information and media can be easily recorded virtually, without us even noticing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big data will change the core of physical market research in the long term, as the world continues to transform into an increasingly digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;"

Why does this bug exist?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don’t find a bug;&lt;/strong&gt; Why didn’t I find this bug? What am I doing wrong?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to know why you couldn’t find that bug. Maybe you were able to find that bug in your practice on the VM but you are not able to find the bug in the actual website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to know Why&lt;/strong&gt;. Possibly the website you are testing has implemented a good security mechanism. So you have to learn what they doing right. Once you know more about doing things right, you will automatically know how to do things wrong. And next time when you go to test another website you will know what these guys are missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The common problem in bug bounty hunters is that once you find a bug, you get over excited. You want to get paid for it quickly, your focus redirects to money and you stop logical thinking at $200 bounty. And as a result, sometimes your bug will have much more impact. Only if you think more and questions, you can make it to $2000 or even $20000 bounty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, as a web security researcher, you take regular everyday things and think of malicious ways of using those things. So, asking questions will keep you from looking at the website from a bird’s eye view and find low hanging fruit i.e, security vulnerabilities without any serious impact. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You need to know everything that&#39;s happening in the web development world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to be an above average web security researcher, you have to take a closer and deeper look at how the different technologies used by the website come together. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Asking questions will help you do so&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This post was originally published &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinxloud.com/why-questioning-is-pivotal-to-successful-career-in-web-security/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"
